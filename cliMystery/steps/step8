Congratulations! You caught the murderer!

To close the investigation and let the courts do their work, save his name in a file called 'jail.txt'.

Change permissions on the file so that you are the only one able to edit it (everyone else can read the contents). There was a case last summer where a convict was switched out for an innocent man on the way to jail - and we don't want that happening again!

Add & commit 'jail.txt' and push to GitHub. 

Now make a pull request from your fork (see hint8 if unsure) back to the original Manchester Codes repository so the chief can review your work.

You can now relax and wait for that promotion, Detective!
